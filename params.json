  "body": "# The CloudLens programming language\r\n\r\n# Installation\r\n\r\nCloudLens requires Apache Maven (tested with version 3.3.1 and above)\r\nand Java 8.\r\n\r\nBefore building, export JAVA\\_HOME to point to a Java 8 JDK.\r\n\r\n```\r\nexport JAVA_HOME=/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk1.8.0_101.jdk/Contents/Home\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo build, execute the following command in the `cloudlens` folder.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build-notebook.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis operation may take a few minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no need to rebuild the notebook after each repository update.\r\nIf you already have a working version of the notebook, to update\r\nCloudLens, just execute the following command in the `cloudlens`\r\nfolder.\r\n\r\n```\r\n./build.sh\r\n```\r\n\r\n# Use\r\n\r\nThere are two execution modes: [table](#table-processing) and\r\n[stream](#stream-processing) processing.\r\n\r\n## Table Processing\r\n\r\nThis is the default execution mode.  CloudLens stores the entire log\r\nhistory. It is thus possible to re-stream from the begining of the log\r\nan arbitrary number of time.\r\n\r\nThis mode can be used for troubleshooting, for instance, to determine\r\nthe causes of a crash from a particular log file.\r\n\r\nTo run a lens file `file.lens` on the log file `file.log`, use the\r\nexecutable `cloudlens`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./cloudlens -run file.lens -log file.log\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Stream Processing\r\n\r\nIn streaming mode, CloudLens does not store the log history.  Hence,\r\nexecuting a script requires much less memory, but it is impossible to\r\nre-stream from the begining of the log.\r\n\r\nThis mode can be used for monitoring running systems (with a\r\npotentially infinite log stream), to report alerting states. It can\r\nalso be useful for analysing huge log files without loading the entire\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nIf no log file is provided, CloudLens uses the standard input. It can thus\r\nbe plugged to a running system with a simple unix pipe.  For example,\r\nto run CloudLens on system.log:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntail -f /var/log/system.log | ./cloudlens -run file.lens\r\n```\r\n\r\nTo activate the streaming mode while providing a log file, use the\r\n`-stream` option:\r\n\r\n```\r\n ./cloudlens -stream -run file.lens -log file.log\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn both modes, it is also possible to load multiple log files and\r\nmultiple lens files:\r\n\r\n```\r\n./cloudlens -run lens1.lens lens2.lens lens3.lens -log log1.log log2.log\r\n```\r\n\r\nLog files are concatenated, and lens files are loaded in\r\nsequence.\r\n\r\n",
